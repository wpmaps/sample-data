Working on Shopify Themes is simple â€“ you can do some pretty amazing things with little effort. We have compiled a set of product CSVs which contain high quality images and product data, like variants, which you can import directly into your store. The product CSVs will create high quality product data you can start working with when building your themes and stores on Shopify.
