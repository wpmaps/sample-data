They add weight, increase drag, and transmit harsh road bumps up to the rider, but for years they've been the only way to keep your hubs attached to your wheels. <em>Until now.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks to dynamo-hub powered electromagnets, neodymium rim inserts, and some engineering magic, the Nikola makes spokes a thing of the past. At low speeds, the magnetic field generated keeps the rims stable and allows some wiggle-room to absorb road shock (imagine invisible magnetic shocks and you'll get a sense of how cool it is), at higher speeds the stronger field keeps your rims stiff so you don't lose any energy to flexing like on a standard spoked wheel. This is bascially the coolest thing you're going to see all year. 1 part mag-lev train, 1 part urban-assault bicycle, 100% Pure.</p>

You can purchase products like this from <a href=""https://www.purefixcycles.com"" target=""_blank"">Pure Fix Cycles</a></em></p><p>The original bicycle frame handle launched by Walnut Studiolo on <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/walnutstudiolo/bicycle-frame-handle"" target=""_blank"">Kickstarter</a>. The frame handle (a.k.a. “The Little Lifter”!)  is a comfortable, stylish, sturdy, and easy-to-use leather handle for carrying your bicycle, whether it's up the stairs, across the tracks, or onto the metro.          </p>
<p>Designed for commuters, this minimalist handle makes carrying your bike actually feel easier and lighter by lowering the center of gravity and using your normal muscle groups for lifting and holding your bicycle, same as lifting a grocery bag or carrying a briefcase. </p>
<p>Most riders pick up their bike by the top tube, which requires you to bend your elbow at an uncomfortable angle. This causes strain on your elbow and shoulder and makes carrying your bike any distance feel awkward.</p>
<p>Because it’s easier to lift a bike with the Frame Handle, you’re more in control when walking up stairs or in a crowded setting.</p>
<p>The Frame Handle has two adjustable buckles. One that wraps around the down-tube and one around the seat-tube. It can be mounted above the derailleur and below most water bottle cages.</p>
<p>The leather used is USA-tanned leather from American steers in St. Louis, Missouri with hardware sourced from an Ohio leather company.</p>",Walnut Studiolo,Bike Accessories,"Accessories, City Accessories, Goods, Leather, Things We Love",42,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0923/8062/products/little-lifter-all-web.jpeg?v=1438624947

<h3>Don’t Waste Watts</h3>
<p>The Siva Atom converts your bike’s motion into electricity, so you’re not just the motor, you’re a generator! And thanks to the removable battery, the power you put into the pedals gets harnessed to breathe new life into dying electronics. Never worry about getting to the party with a dead phone again! Siva Juliet will get you wherever you’re going with speed, style, and plenty of juice.</p>

<div class=""col50 float-right"">
<h3>Will the Atom work with fenders or a rack?</h3>
<p>The Atom works well with fenders as it mounts inside the confines of the frame. Aaron has fenders on his bike (a Surly Cross-Check) and the Atom fits great. For racks, depending on the type of rack and the mounting point on the frame, there may be a need for a small spacer (~5mm). We’ve tested it on all the bikes we can get a hold of and the 5mm rule has been holding true.</p>
<h3>How much resistance does the Atom add to riding?</h3>
<p>The resistance is very small, and is proportional to how large your charging load is. At full generating capacity, it is akin to riding with your tires at 70 psi instead of 90 psi, or pedaling up a 0.3% grade. In our use around town, it is very difficult to tell that it’s on the bike.</p>
