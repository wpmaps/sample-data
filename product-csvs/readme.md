# Shopify Product CSVs and Images

Shopify is a powerful platform, which makes it easy to build a beautiful online store quickly. One way to make that process even quicker is importing products via CSV. A CSV file, also known as comma-separated values file, stores tabular data (numbers and text) as plain text. Importing product data via CSV can speed up your design or development process by providing data to populate your store quicklyâ€”instead of copying and pasting lorem-ipsum text into product descriptions, and searching for photos.
